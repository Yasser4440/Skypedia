# Skypedia
An In-Game Wiki creator tool for Minecraft Bedrock addons. 

- Resource Packs generated by this tool use the How to play screen to display information, recipes, sources, and uses for Addon items.
- This tool just generates the ui files for the addon, you can add them you your ui folder, or merge them together.
- The template in this repo has vanilla items and blocks for reference. Replace them with the items of your addon. (the more items, the longer it takes to load)
- This tool uses Node.js scripts to generate the files, so you need to install nodejs on your machine, and be familiar with the command prompt.
